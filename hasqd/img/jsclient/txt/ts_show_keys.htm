<i><b>Show keys</b></i>
This section shows the keys to a particular token for transfer ownership.  
If you would like to pass the ownership of your own token to 
another person (or another master key), you have to generate these 
keys and pass them to the receiver. No information about the master 
key is revealed. The transfer can be executed instantly or via 
intermediate "On Hold" state. In the second case the token becomes 
locked until either party releases it with the button "Release".

<p style="text-align: left;">
<i><b>"Instant" button</b></i>
This will show the keys for instant transfer. Once the receiver 
uses these keys, the ownership is changed.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
<i><b>"On hold" button</b></i>
These keys, once used by the receiver, lock the token until you or 
the receiver release it. Normally in this case the transfer occurs 
in two steps. First, you pass these keys and the receiver locks 
the token. At this point neither you nor the receiver has the 
control over the token. Finally, you pass the second part of 
the keys. When the receiver uses those, the ownership is fully transferred.

<p style="text-align: left;">
<i><b>"Release" button, when you transfer</b></i>
This button generates the keys for the second step of the transaction.
</p>
<hr/>

<p style="text-align: left;">
<i><b>"Release" button, when you receive</b></i>
Use this button if you would like to reverse the transaction. 
This is when someone sends you the first part of the keys and the 
token is put "On hold", but you decide to reverse the transaction,
returning the ownership back to the sender.
