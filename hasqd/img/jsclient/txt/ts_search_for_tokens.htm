<p style="text-align: left;">
This section allows you to look up your tokens. The 
client will go through the blocks trying to match 
the key to different tokens. The left buttons list 
tokens in three different states. "Mine" shows the 
tokens which are controlled by the current 
key. "On hold" and "Expected" show partially owned tokens.
